Eventually this folder will contain all our research that we want to share with each other. 

This link is to a research article that seems to have done what we want to do. To read it you have to go through academic search premier in the online csu library search tools.

In case that link doesn't work the title is "Automatic melody composition based on a probabilistic model of music style and harmonic rules"
